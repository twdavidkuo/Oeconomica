;; CMSC 15100, Winter 2020
;; Lab 2 evaluation

;; This evaluation is for the student with cnet kuot.

;; === correctness ===

;; plausible?          3 / 3
;; adjusted-income     3 / 3
;; income-tax          5 / 5

;; child-deduction     3 / 3
;; dog-deduction       2 / 3
;;GRADER: The dog deduction shouldn't have a maximum value (if it's greater than the income tax, then that should be accounted for in tax-owed).

;; tax-owed            3 / 3
;; effective-tax-rate  3 / 3

==> correctness subtotal 22/23

;; === style ===

;; contracts (type ascriptions)        3 / 3
;; well-written purposes               3 / 3

;; lines are <= 80 characters long     1 / 1
;; code layout                         3 / 3
;; identifiers are well named          3 / 3

;; adequate tests                      8 / 8

;; clarity (clear logic)               5 / 5
;; git used correctly                  1 / 1

==> style subtotal 27/27

==> Note: the scoring formula is given here.

The following scoring formula has the effect of scaling style by
correctness. This is so a student cannot, for example, write only one
function out of six and earn full style points.

Let c = correctness points.
Let p = correctness percentage.
Let s = style points.
The total score is (c + p*s), rounded to the nearest integer.

For example, if a student earned 20/23 correctness points and 22/27
style points, the total score would be as follows:

round(20+((20/23)*22)/100 = 39/50
