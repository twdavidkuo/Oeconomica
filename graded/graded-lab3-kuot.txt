***************************************************

==> Note: the scoring formula is given here.

The following scoring formula has the effect of scaling style by
correctness. This is so a student cannot, for example, write only one
function out of six and earn full style points.

Let c = correctness points.
Let p = correctness percentage.
Let s = style points.
The total score is (c + p*s), rounded to the nearest integer.

For example, if a student earned 20/28 correctness points and 22/22
style points, the total score would be as follows:

round(20+((20/28)*22)/50 = 36/50
